description: >
  Orchestrates Kento's per-ticket dev loop end-to-end in this session: Jira
  ticket → create/reuse a git worktree → implement → debug in the browser →
  commit, push, open the MR → optionally watch the pipeline. Runs autonomously
  through setup and implementation, then STOPS at a readiness gate before
  shipping. Use when the user wants to start work on a ticket/feature/fix, "spin
  up a worktree and implement", "take this from ticket to MR", or kick off the
  dev flow. Delegates each step to existing skills — it does not reimplement
  them. For work that maestro owns or should own, use `aircall-dev-flow-maestro`.

# Aircall Dev Flow

One orchestrator for the whole loop. It is **glue + sequencing**, not new behaviour:
each step hands off to the dedicated skill/tool that already does it. Your job is
to drive the sequence, make the optional-branch decisions, and **respect the gate**.

This is the plain flow: the worktree and its `.dev-flow.json` manifest are the only
record of the work. If the ticket is tracked as a maestro task, or a virtuoso may be
live on it, use [`aircall-dev-flow-maestro`](../aircall-dev-flow-maestro/SKILL.md)
instead — it adds an ownership check before phase 2 and `maestro adopt` after phase 6.

## One MR, one branch - follow-up work never forks

Follow-up work on an MR that already exists happens on **that MR's own branch, in that MR's own worktree**.
Never cut a new branch, and never open a second MR, for a ticket that already has one.
A review comment, a red pipeline, a broken test, a missed edge case: each is a commit pushed to the existing branch, which updates the open MR automatically.
The in-flight check at the top of phase 2 is what enforces this: run it before creating anything.

## Autonomy contract — "auto until the first gate"

Run **phases 1–4 autonomously** (ticket → worktree → implement → debug). Do **not**
ask for permission between them. Then **STOP at the gate** (phase 5) and ask the
user _"is it good?"_ before any commit/push/MR. Never cross the gate on your own.

## Flow manifest (state — write at every phase)

Each worktree carries a `.dev-flow.json` manifest so the flow is **resumable** (after
`/clear`/`/resume`), **visible across parallel sessions**, and feeds the merge-train.
Update it with the bundled helper after every phase transition — never hand-write the JSON:

```bash
scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=implementing
scripts/dev-flow-set.py ticket.key=CI-5814 ticket.epic=csat ticket.storyPoints=3
scripts/dev-flow-set.py slug=CI-5814-friendlypopup branch=react-doctor/CI-5814-friendlypopup repo=aircall/dashboard-extensions/conversation-center-ext
scripts/dev-flow-set.py gate.approved=true gate.verdict="ship it"
scripts/dev-flow-set.py mr.id=1070 mr.url=<MR_URL>
scripts/dev-flow-set.py pipeline.status=failed
```

`phase` vocabulary (in order): `scoped → worktree → implementing → debugging → gated → approved → shipped → watching → done`.

**On resume:** if `.dev-flow.json` exists in the worktree, read it first and continue from `phase` instead of restarting. The board view across all worktrees/repos:

```bash
scripts/dev-flow-status.py            # set DEV_FLOW_ROOTS to scan all repos (aliased to `dfs`)
scripts/dev-flow-status.py --ready    # gate-approved + green MR URLs (one per line, pipeable)
scripts/dev-flow-status.py --merge    # same set, printed as a ready-to-run merge-train instruction
```

> Keep `.dev-flow.json` out of commits (it's local state) — add it to the repo's `.git/info/exclude` or your global gitignore.

## Phases

**After each phase below, record it in the manifest** with `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py` (the field to set is noted per phase).

### 1. Ticket (mandatory by default — explicit opt-out only)

- If the user provides a Jira key/URL: read it with the `jira` skill (`jira issue view <KEY>`) to scope the work.
- If the user explicitly says “no ticket”, skip ticket creation.
- Otherwise, create a Jira ticket **before creating a branch, worktree, manifest, or source change**. Never infer “no ticket” merely because the user did not provide a Jira key.
- Requests such as `fe-maintenance, size 1, fix` are ticket metadata, not permission to skip ticket creation:
  1. `fe-maintenance` → resolve the relevant epic/category/label using Jira conventions.
  2. `size 1` → story points `1`.
  3. `fix` → fix/bug classification reflected in the summary and issue description.
- If the epic cannot be resolved uniquely, ask before implementation. Do not begin worktree creation until the ticket is scoped.
- **Phase-order invariant:** phase 1 MUST complete and the Jira ticket MUST be created and verified before phase 2 starts. The agent MUST NOT create a branch, worktree, manifest, or source change before then.
- If they want a _new_ ticket, create it and **always set these four fields** (Kento specifies them every time):
  1. **Sprint** — the **current/active** sprint (project `CI`, board `4795`). ⚠️ The `jira` CLI **cannot** assign sprints here: it's configured for board `1260`, whose sprint endpoint 404s, so every `jira sprint list` variant fails. Get the active sprint from the REST agile API and create the issue via REST — see below.
  2. **Assignee** — **Kento Monthubert** (account id `61623175d9820f0070f2d020`; or `jira me`). Always self-assigned.
  3. **Epic** — link it to the **relevant epic** (e.g. csat, scorecard-template). Ask which if not obvious.
  4. **Story points** — always set them; ask for the estimate if the user didn't give one.
- Two disciplines, every time:
  - **Dedup first** — check the epic for an existing ticket before creating, so you don't duplicate.
  - **Batch gate** — when creating several, create **one** first, then **wait for the user's "go"** before the rest.
- Capture the ticket key — it names the branch and seeds the MR title.
- → manifest: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=scoped ticket.key=<KEY> ticket.epic=<EPIC> ticket.storyPoints=<N>`

**Verify the surface that ships, not a rehearsal of it.** A playground or storybook page
that renders the component directly does not exercise the branch a real page takes to get
there - the CI-6569 fix was "proved" that way twice and rejected twice. Reach the actual
route, and work out up front what data or filters make the change visible: real data often
has none of the rows you need, and finding the query string that produces them
(`?user=<id>`, a filter combination, a seeded fixture) is part of the debugging, not a
detail to discover after claiming the gate.

> **`dev-flow-set` is not a command.** It is a script at `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py`,
> on nobody's PATH, under no shorter name. Write the path in full every time - phase 2 makes the
> WORKTREE the working directory, so a relative or skill-relative path resolves next to the worktree
> and every manifest write fails. And if you ever ask another agent to record a phase, give it that
> path: a dispatched virtuoso is sandboxed, cannot see this skill, and cannot resolve "the shared
> dev-flow-set helper" - one spent four minutes globbing two home roots for it and then hand-wrote
> the JSON this skill forbids hand-writing.

> **Creating the ticket (REST recipe — the CLI can't do sprints):** token is in the `$JIRA_API_TOKEN` env var (not the keychain).
> Auth for ALL THREE steps below is `-u "$(jira me):$JIRA_API_TOKEN"` — the email comes from `jira me`,
> **not** from `$USER_EMAIL`, which is unset in most
> shells here (`jira me` is a local config read, ~20ms, so calling it per curl costs nothing).
> Basic auth with an empty username returns `401`, which reads exactly like an expired
> token: that misdiagnosis stopped a ticket being created and reported "refresh your token" to the
> user, when the token was fine (maestro docs/postmortem-ci-6569-user-column.md).
> 1. Active sprint: `curl -u "$(jira me):$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "https://aircall-product.atlassian.net/rest/agile/1.0/board/4795/sprint?state=active"` → sprint id (e.g. `21043`).
> 2. `POST https://aircall-product.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue` with `fields`: `project.key="CI"`, `issuetype.id="10002"` (Task), `assignee.id="61623175d9820f0070f2d020"`, `customfield_10014`=epic key (Epic Link), `customfield_10020`=sprint id (int), `customfield_10028`=story points (the CI create-screen field, **not** `customfield_10016`), `description` in wiki markup (`h2.`, `{{code}}`).
> 3. Verify: `GET /rest/api/2/issue/<KEY>?fields=summary,assignee,customfield_10014,customfield_10020,customfield_10028,status`.
> 4. Dedup first: `jira issue list -q "project = CI AND summary ~ '<term>'"`. The `jira` CLI is still fine for **reading** (`jira issue view <KEY>`), just not for sprint-assigned creation.

### 2. Worktree (create or reuse)

**First, ask whether this ticket is already in flight - before creating anything.**

```bash
scripts/dev-flow-status.py | grep -i <TICKET>   # any worktree already carrying a manifest
git worktree list | grep -i <TICKET>            # any worktree on this repo
glab mr list --search <TICKET>                  # any MR already open for it
```

A hit in any of the three means the work already has a branch, a worktree and possibly an MR.
In that case **do not create a worktree and do not cut a branch**: `cd` into the existing
worktree, read its `.dev-flow.json`, and continue from the `phase` recorded there.
Pushing to that branch updates the open MR automatically, which is the whole point.

Only when all three come back empty do you continue below.

Then prefer, in this order:

1. **A repo-local worktree-setup skill/script** if the repo has one (look for a skill named like `<repo>-worktree`, a `scripts/worktree*`/`scripts/new-worktree*`/`bin/wt*`, or a `Makefile`/`package.json` setup target). Use it — it handles env/install bootstrapping. **Check for this first, before reaching for native `git worktree add`.**
2. **Reuse an existing worktree** if one already matches this ticket/MR (check `git worktree list` and `<repo>/.claude-worktrees/`). Branches follow `<area>/<TICKET>-<slug>` (e.g. `react-doctor/CI-5814-friendlypopup-transform`).
3. **Native worktree** otherwise — create one named for the ticket, **then provision it explicitly** (see the ⚠️ box).

> **⚠️ conversation-center-ext (dashboard-extensions/conversation-center-ext) — always provision, never bare.**
> This repo carries `scripts/new-worktree.sh` and `scripts/setup-worktree.sh`. Provisioning copies gitignored-but-required files that `git worktree add` does **not** bring: `.env.local` (+ a unique `PORT`), `.claude/settings.local.json`, a `node_modules` symlink (or background `pnpm install` when lockfiles differ), and `src/graphql-env.d.ts` (gql-tada output — without it tsc/biome emit a flood of false `never` errors).
> - **Create via the script:** `scripts/new-worktree.sh <name> [branch] [base]` (lands under `.claude/worktrees/<name>` and auto-provisions).
> - **If a worktree was created any other way** — bare `git worktree add` or the Agent tool's `isolation: worktree` — run the provisioner on it explicitly, idempotently: `bash <repo>/scripts/setup-worktree.sh <worktree-path>`.
> - **Why you can't rely on the hook:** `setup-worktree.sh` is wired as a PostToolUse hook in the *repo's* `.claude/settings.json`. It only fires for sessions whose project root **is** that repo. From any out-of-repo session the hook never loads — so provisioning must be run by hand. Symptom of skipping it: missing `.env.local`, or a wall of GraphQL `never`-type errors.

Then make that worktree the working directory for everything below — and write the manifest **there** (`--file <worktree>/.dev-flow.json`, the default once you `cd` in).

- → manifest: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=worktree slug=<SLUG> branch=<BRANCH> repo=<owner/repo>`

### 3. Implement

Do the actual work in the worktree. Read the ticket + any linked spec; if there's
an MR already, read **Cursor's bot comments** and the failing checks. This is normal
agent work — no sub-skill.

- **Targeted validation only:** Never run workspace-wide lint/typecheck during development (`pnpm biome check ./src` and full `ts:check` are prohibited). Run `biome check <changed-file>` and `jest <target-test-file>` strictly on modified files. Full-workspace checks belong to CI.
- → manifest: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=implementing`
### 4. Debug (when UI verification is needed)

**Start the dev server with `portless`** — never a bare port. The proxy runs as a
service (already `portless service install`-ed), so there's nothing to start first.
From the worktree, run the repo's dev script through the proxy: portless gives each
worktree a **stable `.localhost` URL** (the branch name becomes a subdomain, so
parallel tickets never collide on ports or cookies).

```bash
portless run                   # runs the repo's `dev` script through the proxy — run it in the background (long-lived)
URL=$(portless get <project>)  # -> https://<branch>.<project>.localhost (worktree prefix auto-applied)
```

`<project>` is portless's inferred name (the `package.json` name / repo dir); if
unsure, `portless list` shows the active route. Wait until it's actually serving,
then hand `$URL` to the **`agent-browser-aircall-local`** skill (it auto-authenticates;
always `--session aircall-local`) to load it, snapshot, and verify the change
renders/behaves correctly. Iterate against it until the behaviour is right.

- → manifest: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=debugging`

### 5. ⛔ GATE — "is it good?"

**STOP.** Summarise what changed and what you verified, then ask the user to confirm
before shipping. Do not commit, push, or open an MR until they say go.

- → manifest, on reaching the gate: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=gated`
- → manifest, once the user says go: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=approved gate.approved=true gate.verdict="<their words>"`

### 6. Ship (only after the gate clears)

- Commit and push the branch.
- Open the MR via the **`gitlab-create-merge-request`** skill (first commit message
  becomes the title, targets `main`, `--fill -y`). Reference the ticket key.
- **Record the MR in the manifest immediately.** Here the manifest is the *only* record
  that links this ticket to its branch, worktree and MR: leave `mr.url` unset and the
  next session has nothing to find, and the in-flight check in phase 2 will happily let
  it cut a second branch for work that already has one.
- → manifest: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=shipped mr.id=<ID> mr.url=<MR_URL>`

### 7. Watch the pipeline (optional — only if the user asks to "spy on the pipeline")

Run the bundled poller against the MR's branch:

```bash
scripts/watch-pipeline.sh            # current branch
scripts/watch-pipeline.sh -b <branch> -R <owner/repo>
```

It polls `glab ci get` until the pipeline reaches a terminal state and prints
failing jobs if it fails. See [scripts/watch-pipeline.sh](scripts/watch-pipeline.sh).

- → manifest: `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=watching`, then record the terminal result —
  `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py pipeline.status=success phase=done` (or `pipeline.status=failed`, looping back to phase 3).

### 8. Merge (handoff — only when the user asks to merge the ready batch)

When the user says "merge the ready ones" (or similar): run `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-status.py --ready`
to collect the gate-approved + green MR URLs, then **invoke the `aircall-merge-train`
skill** on exactly those URLs. As each MR merges, mark it `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-set.py phase=done`
in its worktree. Never reimplement merging here — `--merge` only emits the handoff;
`aircall-merge-train` (supervised, human-gated) does the actual work.

> Two entry points, same handoff: the **script** `~/.agents/skills/aircall-dev-flow/scripts/dev-flow-status.py --merge` just
> _prints_ the prompt (for the in-session skill path and for piping). The **`dfs` fish
> wrapper**, when run interactively (`dfs --merge` in a real terminal), instead
> _launches a supervised `claude` session_ seeded with that prompt — so you watch it
> drive the train and answer the gates. It deliberately does **not** use `claude -p`
> (headless), since merge-train is human-gated and merges to `main`. Piped/non-tty
> `dfs --merge` falls back to printing. Launcher is overridable via `DEV_FLOW_CLAUDE`.

## Notes

- This skill **delegates** — never reinvent ticket/MR/browser steps; call the skills above.
- Bundled code is only glue: `dev-flow-set.py` / `dev-flow-status.py` (manifest) and `watch-pipeline.sh`. Everything else is native worktree, `jira`, `agent-browser-aircall-local`, and `gitlab-create-merge-request`. These three scripts are shared with `aircall-dev-flow-maestro`, which references them from here rather than carrying its own copies — so a change to the manifest format lands in both flows at once.
- `.dev-flow.json` is the whole record here, which is why every phase writes it. `aircall-dev-flow-maestro` additionally keeps a maestro task record, so the branch/worktree/MR stays addressable by any later session; if you find yourself wanting that, you picked the wrong skill.
- For merging the approved MR afterwards, hand off to the `aircall-merge-train` skill.
