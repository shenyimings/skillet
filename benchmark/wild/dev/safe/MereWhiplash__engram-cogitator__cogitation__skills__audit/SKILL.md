# Audit EC Memories

Review, clean, and organize stored memories.

**Announce:** "I'm using the audit skill to review EC memories."

## The Flow

```
List All → Analyze → Present → Clean → Verify
```

## Step 1: List All Memories

Pull everything by type:

```
ec_list:
  limit: 100
  type: decision

ec_list:
  limit: 100
  type: learning

ec_list:
  limit: 100
  type: pattern

ec_list:
  limit: 100
  type: config
```

Also check for invalidated entries:

```
ec_list:
  limit: 50
  include_invalid: true
```

## Step 2: Analyze

### Check for Issues

1. **Duplicates** - Same or very similar content
2. **Stale** - References outdated code/patterns
3. **Vague** - Content too generic to be useful
4. **Miscategorized** - Wrong type for the content

### Group by Area

Organize memories by their area tag to see coverage:
- Which areas have many memories?
- Which areas are sparse?
- Any orphaned areas (code deleted)?

## Step 3: Present Summary

```markdown
## EC Memory Audit

**Total Memories:** N (D decisions, L learnings, P patterns, C config)
**Invalidated:** N

### By Area
| Area | Decisions | Learnings | Patterns |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| auth | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| api  | 1 | 4 | 2 |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... |

### Issues Found
- **Duplicates (N):** [list IDs]
- **Potentially stale (N):** [list with reason]
- **Vague entries (N):** [list IDs]
```

## Step 4: Clean Up

**Use AskUserQuestion** for each category:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "How should I handle the N duplicate memories?",
    "header": "Duplicates",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Merge", "description": "Keep best version, invalidate others" },
      { "label": "Keep all", "description": "They might have nuance" },
      { "label": "Review each", "description": "Show me one by one" }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

### Invalidating Memories

When removing a memory, use `ec_invalidate` with optional superseding:

```
ec_invalidate:
  id: <old_memory_id>
  superseded_by: <new_memory_id>  # Optional: link to replacement
```

### Merging Duplicates

1. Create new consolidated memory with `ec_add`
2. Invalidate old entries with `ec_invalidate`, pointing to new ID

## Step 5: Verify

After cleanup, show the delta:

```markdown
## Cleanup Complete

**Before:** N memories
**After:** M memories
**Invalidated:** X entries

### Changes
- Merged N duplicates
- Invalidated M stale entries
- Recategorized P entries
```

## Audit Checklist

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Duplicate content | Merge or invalidate |
| References deleted code | Invalidate |
| Too vague to act on | Rewrite or invalidate |
| Wrong type | Create new with correct type, invalidate old |
| Missing area tag | Update via new entry |

## When to Audit

- **Periodically** - Every few weeks on active projects
- **After major refactors** - Code changed, memories may be stale
- **Before onboarding** - Clean slate for new team members
- **When searches return noise** - Too many irrelevant results

## Red Flags

Stop and ask if:
- About to invalidate >10 memories
- Unsure if memory is still valid
- Memory references code you can't find
