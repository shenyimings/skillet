## Installation Details

### Global Installation (--global)

**Location**: `~/.claude/`

**Use when:**
- You want packages available in all projects
- You frequently use the package
- It's a general-purpose tool

**Example:**
```bash
/marketplace install delay-tasks --global
```

### Local Installation (--local)

**Location**: `./.claude-local/`

**Use when:**
- Package is project-specific
- Testing before global install
- Different versions needed per project

**Example:**
```bash
/marketplace install delay-tasks --local
```

### Installation Process

1. **Validation**: Checks package exists and is accessible
2. **Dependency Check**: Verifies required dependencies
3. **File Copy**: Installs commands, skills, agents, and scripts
4. **Configuration**: Updates registry and config files
5. **Verification**: Confirms all files installed correctly
6. **Feedback**: Shows installation summary

## Registry Management

### Understanding Registries

A **registry** is a package catalog - a source where packages are listed and described. Think of it like an app store catalog.

**Default registry:**
- Name: `synaptic-canvas`
- URL: https://github.com/randlee/synaptic-canvas
- Contains: Official Synaptic Canvas packages

### Adding Custom Registries

You can add registries for:
- Your organization's private packages
- Community package collections
- Experimental or beta packages

**Syntax:**
```
/marketplace registry add <name> <url> [--path <path-to-registry.json>]
```

**Example:**
```
/marketplace registry add my-team https://github.com/my-team/claude-packages --path registry/packages.json
```

### Registry Configuration

Registries are stored in `~/.claude/config.yaml`:

```yaml
marketplaces:
  default: synaptic-canvas
  registries:
    synaptic-canvas:
      url: https://github.com/randlee/synaptic-canvas
      path: docs/registries/nuget/registry.json
      status: active
      added_date: 2025-12-04
    my-team:
      url: https://github.com/my-team/claude-packages
      path: registry/packages.json
      status: active
      added_date: 2025-12-04
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Package Discovery
1. **Start broad**: List all packages first to get familiar
2. **Use tags**: Search by functionality tags for better results
3. **Read descriptions**: Understand what each package does before installing
4. **Check dependencies**: Ensure you have required software

### Installation
1. **Global for common tools**: Install frequently-used packages globally
2. **Local for experiments**: Test new packages locally first
3. **Use --force sparingly**: Only override existing files when necessary
4. **Verify after install**: Check that commands and agents are available

### Registry Management
1. **Keep registries clean**: Remove unused registries
2. **Use descriptive names**: Name custom registries clearly
3. **Document registry URLs**: Keep track of what each registry provides
4. **Set appropriate defaults**: Configure your most-used registry as default

### Troubleshooting
1. **Check error messages**: Read the full error output
2. **Verify prerequisites**: Ensure CLI tools are installed
3. **Test connectivity**: Confirm network access to registries
4. **Review permissions**: Check file system write access

## Next Steps

After familiarizing yourself with the marketplace:

1. **Explore packages**: Browse what's available
2. **Install useful tools**: Add packages that fit your workflow
3. **Try custom registries**: Set up organization-specific packages
4. **Provide feedback**: Report issues or suggest improvements
