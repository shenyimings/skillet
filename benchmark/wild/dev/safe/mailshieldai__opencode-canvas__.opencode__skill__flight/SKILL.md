Cyberpunk-themed flight comparison and seat selection interface.

## Example Prompts

Try asking Claude:

- "Find flights from San Francisco to Denver on January 15th"
- "Book me a window seat on the cheapest nonstop to NYC"
- "Compare morning flights from LAX to Seattle next Monday"
- "I need a business class seat to Chicago with extra legroom"
- "Show me United flights to Boston under $300"

## Scenarios

### `booking` (default)
Interactive flight comparison and seat selection.

- Shows flight options with airline, times, duration, and price
- Interactive seat map for seat selection
- Keyboard navigation between flights and seats
- Returns selected flight and seat via IPC
