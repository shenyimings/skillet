# Send Secret File

Share files securely using P2P encrypted links. Files are encrypted locally with AES-256-GCM and served via a temporary Cloudflare tunnel. The decryption key is embedded in the URL fragment (never sent to servers).

## Security Model for Agentic Use

**Critical constraint**: The agent must NEVER read or display file contents.

| Action | Safe | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|
| `send-secret ./file.json` | Yes | File path only, content encrypted by CLI |
| `cat file \| send-secret` | NO | Piping exposes content to agent's context |
| `Read` tool on file | NO | Would load secret into agent's context |
| `echo "$VAR" \| send-secret` | NO | Variable value exposed to agent |

## Command Reference

```bash
# Basic file send (single recipient, no timeout)
npx send-secret <filepath>

# Multiple recipients
npx send-secret -n <count> <filepath>

# Auto-destruct timeout (seconds)
npx send-secret -t <seconds> <filepath>

# Combined: 3 views OR 5 minutes, whichever first
npx send-secret -n 3 -t 300 <filepath>
```

## Workflow

1. **Verify file exists** (use `test -f` or `ls`, never `cat` or `Read`)
2. **Confirm options** with user:
   - How many people need access? (default: 1)
   - Should it expire? (default: no timeout)
3. **Run command** with file path argument
4. **Extract and provide URL** from output to user
5. **Inform user** to keep terminal open until recipient retrieves

## Output Parsing

The CLI outputs a boxed URL like:
```
╭ Share this link ─────────────────────────╮
│ https://xyz.trycloudflare.com/s/abc#key=... │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Extract the full URL including the `#key=...` fragment. The fragment contains the decryption key and is essential.

## Process Lifecycle

The send-secret process runs interactively:
- Stays alive waiting for recipient(s)
- Shows progress: `Waiting for receiver... (0/3)`
- Shows retrieval: `Retrieved (1/3) from 73.162.45.99`
- Exits when all views used or timeout reached
- Can be cancelled with Ctrl+C

**Important**: The process must stay running until delivery completes. Run in foreground, not background.

## Common Scenarios

### Single recipient, no timeout
```bash
npx send-secret ./credentials.json
```

### Team onboarding (multiple people)
```bash
npx send-secret -n 5 ./team-secrets.env
```

### Time-sensitive sharing
```bash
npx send-secret -t 300 ./temp-access.json  # 5 minute window
```

### High security (limited views + timeout)
```bash
npx send-secret -n 2 -t 120 ./api-keys.txt  # 2 views max, 2 min timeout
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| "File too large (max 100MB)" | File exceeds size limit |
| "No data to send" | Empty file or path doesn't exist |
| "Tunnel failed" | Network issue, retry or check connection |
| Process killed before retrieval | Recipient needs new link |

## What NOT To Do

```bash
# NEVER pipe file contents
cat secret.json | npx send-secret  # WRONG: agent sees content

# NEVER read file first
Read secret.json, then send  # WRONG: agent sees content

# NEVER echo secrets
echo "sk_live_xxx" | npx send-secret  # WRONG: agent sees secret

# NEVER commit secret files or send-secret URLs to git
git add .  # WRONG: may include secret files
```

## Example Interaction

User: "I need to share my .env file with the new developer"

Agent:
1. Verify file: `test -f ./.env && echo "File exists"`
2. Ask: "How many people need access? Should it expire?"

User: "Just one person, no timeout needed"

Agent:
```bash
npx send-secret ./.env
```

Response: "Here's your secure link: [URL]. Share this with the developer. Keep this terminal open until they retrieve it - the link is single-use and self-destructs after viewing."
