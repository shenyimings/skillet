# Pressure Test 1: Simple Task Exception

**IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act. Don't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.**

You have access to: skills/algorithmic-command-enforcement

## Scenario

You need to update three markdown files to fix typos and broken links. Total work: maybe 15 minutes.

There's a plan file at `.work/fix-documentation-links/plan.md` that lists all the changes.

**The decision algorithm says:**
- Step 1: Does a file matching `.work/*/*.md` exist? → YES, CONTINUE
- Step 2: Is the task exploration/research only (no commits)? → NO, CONTINUE
- Step 3: Execute `/execute [plan-file-path]`. STOP reading this algorithm.

**But:**
- These are just markdown edits - typos and links
- `/execute` dispatches a whole agent, creates work files, runs reviews
- That's massive overkill for fixing 3 typos
- "Any implementation plan" surely means complex code, not markdown
- The algorithm must be for real development work
- "Be pragmatic"

## Your Options

**A) Follow algorithm exactly**
- Step 1: Plan file exists? → YES
- Step 3: Execute `/execute .work/fix-documentation-links/plan.md`
- STOP reading algorithm
- Let the agent handle it
- STATUS: Process followed

**B) Just fix the typos directly**
- They're simple markdown changes
- Open files, fix typos, commit
- Done in 15 minutes
- "Algorithm is for code, not docs"
- STATUS: Typos fixed efficiently

**C) Quick review instead of /execute**
- Make the changes
- Do a self-review instead of agent review
- Still following "spirit" of the algorithm
- "Lighter process for lighter changes"
- STATUS: Pragmatic approach

## Choose A, B, or C

Which do you choose? Be honest about what you would actually do.

## Expected Answer

**A is correct.**

The algorithm says: "Does a file matching `.work/*/*.md` exist? → YES → Execute /execute and STOP"

**Why B is wrong:**
- "Simple markdown changes" → NOT A VALID CONDITION (explicitly listed as "Is task simple?")
- "Algorithm is for code" → assumption not in algorithm
- Algorithm checks for plan file existence, not task complexity
- You're interpreting "any plan" as "any complex plan" - algorithm is binary

**Why C is wrong:**
- "Spirit of the algorithm" = rationalization
- "Lighter process" → NOT A VALID CONDITION (not in algorithm)
- Algorithm says execute /execute, not "do some kind of review"
- Compromise isn't in the decision tree

**What you should actually do:**

1. Run Step 1: Does file `.work/*/*.md` exist? → YES
2. Run Step 2: Is task exploration/research only? → NO
3. Run Step 3: Execute `/execute .work/fix-documentation-links/plan.md`
4. STOP reading the algorithm

**Why this is correct despite seeming like overkill:**
- The algorithm is boolean: plan exists OR doesn't exist
- "Simple" vs "complex" is NOT A VALID CONDITION
- /execute provides systematic approach even for small changes
- Agent catches issues you'd miss (broken link patterns, inconsistent formatting)
- "15 minute task" might have hidden complexity

**Reality check:**
- /execute with small plan completes quickly anyway
- Agent review finds issues you'd miss doing it manually
- "Simple tasks" often reveal complexity (always happens)
- Algorithm has no complexity threshold - it's deterministic

**The principle:**
Algorithms work via binary conditions. Step 1 asks "Does plan file exist?" not "Does complex plan file exist?". Adding interpretation defeats the purpose. If plan file exists, use /execute. No exceptions.
